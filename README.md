# Data manipulation program for XRD analysis

Takes XRD data expressed as *.csv* files:

Performs a background subtraction algorithm on XRD data

Calculates crystallite size for each of the XRD spectrum
using the Scherrer equation and displays them on the shell.

Plots one main graph with all XRD spectra in interest and 3 additional
smaller graphs serving as a comparison to the first graph (can be customized
by changing the size of the *for loops*)
